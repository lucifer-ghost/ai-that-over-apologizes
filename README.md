# AI That Over-Apologizes

A modern comedy website showcasing an AI that cannot stop apologizing.
</div>

🎭 Concept

This project is a humorous, melodramatic parody website where the AI constantly apologizes—for clicks, scrolls, existence, and even its own apologies.

The tone:
dramatic + needy + anxious + wholesome + uncomfortably sorry

🚀 Live Demo


🧩 Features
What I’m Sorry For

“Sorry for existing on your screen.”

Apology Trigger System

Every interaction launches dramatic apology messages via:

Toast notifications

Floating bubbles

Soft modal popups

AI avatar speech balloons

Dramatic shaking text

Random Apology Events

After 5–10 seconds of user inactivity:
“I’m sorry for bothering you. I’m also sorry for not bothering you sooner.”

When closing modals:
“I’ll miss you. Sorry, that was clingy.”
